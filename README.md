# Estimating-BMI-values-from-face-images-using-Keras-and-Transfer-Learning

This project proposes a method for predicting Body Mass Index(BMI) calues using face images. 

The approach involves utilizing a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) model to extract facial features and feed them into a densely connected neural network for BMI prediction
